# Platform Economics

## Introduction

This document describes the economics of construction, equipment and operation of an autonomous platform for 15 permanent residents, with all engineering, biotechnological and operational parameters calculated for 10+ years of service at sea.

## Capital Expenditures and Construction

### Construction Stages

- Manufacturing and installation of foam glass SWAHH columns and deck.
- Frame assembly and modular superstructures (residential, technical and public blocks).
- Installation of energy systems: 12 OWC chambers, 3 Magnus rotors, solar panels, backup diesel generator.
- Biofarm installation, workshop, life support systems.
- Equipment with internal communications, spare parts, equipment.
- Commissioning, autonomous testing, automation system setup.

### Cost Structure (in US Dollars)

| Section                  | Cost  |
|--------------------------|------:|
| Hull and support columns (foam glass, deck, frame) |   450,000 |
| Residential, public, technical blocks                        |   160,000 |
| Energy systems (OWC, Magnus, solar, electrical)      |   220,000 |
| Biofarm and water system                                |   125,000 |
| Workshop, tools, spare parts                            |    65,000 |
| Logistics, installation, reserve                              |    80,000 |
| Backup diesel generator 20–25 kW (equipment + integration) |    20,000 |
| **Total**                                              | **1,120,000** |

*Estimate — on conditions of self-construction, without major external contractor.*

### Work Composition and Timeline

- Optimal team — 8–12 people (technical specialists, builders, installers, biofarm engineer).
- Construction and equipment timeline — 18–24 months.
- All processes maximally modular, parallelized, part of equipment/interior work conducted simultaneously with main installation stages.

## Equipment and Outfitting

- Main materials — foam glass (own production), standard metal stock, modular sandwich panels, composite.
- Energy:  
  — 12 OWC chambers (wave energy, peak power up to 560 kW),  
  — 3 Magnus rotors (wind energy),  
  — solar power station (20 kW),  
  — backup diesel generator 20–25 kW (for emergencies, startup/charging, fire/storm).
- Biofarm:  
  — Hydroponic and aquaponic modules,  
  — photobioreactors for microalgae,  
  — animal zones (guinea pigs, pigs, goats, poultry),  
  — insectarium, vermiculture, mushroom blocks.
- Life support system:  
  — desalinators and water treatment system,  
  — water and waste reservoirs,  
  — biomass processing/disposal system.
- Workshop and spare parts:  
  — basic and extended tool kit,  
  — consumables, spare parts for 2–3 years,  
  — materials for current repair and independent production of small structures.

## Operating Expenses

- Current expenses after startup — $20,000–35,000 per year (for 15 people):
    - Spare parts (spare parts, consumables, filters, fasteners)
    - Medicine (first aid kit, tests, specific preparations, annual audit)
    - Biomaterials (seeds, breeding stock, culture renewal)
    - Equipment (clothing, household items)
    - Communications, information system support (satellite/internet, updates)
    - Periodic equipment/infrastructure upgrade
    - Backup diesel generator repair and maintenance (when necessary)
- Diesel generator fuel purchased 2–3 years ahead (1–2 tons), minimal consumption (emergency mode).
- Main part of operating expenses falls on biofarm and microbiocenosis maintenance (spare parts, veterinary).

## Living Economics (TCO)

- For 15 permanent residents, 10-year calculation:
    - Total capital and operating costs — $1,320,000–1,470,000 (considering average operating expenses).
    - Per resident: **$8,000/year** (including construction, equipment, operation, depreciation, spare parts).
- With increased resident numbers short-term (up to 30–50): cost increase no more than 15–20% (using reserves and forced farm mode).
- Comparison:  
    — Similar area motor yacht spends $120,000–250,000 per year on fuel and maintenance and requires professional crew.

## Risks and Economic Reserves

- Budget includes reserve of at least 10% for unforeseen expenses (failed experiments, equipment failures, one-time major repairs).
- For complex or emergency situations there is always backup energy source (diesel generator, fuel, spare batteries).
- All main consumables (spare parts for energy, farm, water, automation) stored in quantities sufficient for minimum 2 years autonomy.
- Every 2–3 years recommended to update biomaterials, replenish spare parts and first aid kit, audit technical systems and major repair if needed.

## Conclusions

- Platform ensures autonomous living for 15 people with 2–3 year complete isolation reserve and possibility of long-term functioning with periodic minimal supply.
- Total cost of ownership is an order of magnitude lower than any marine vessel of similar class by living volume and autonomy.
- System economics built on own production, renewable energy and minimal operating costs.
- For further optimization and cost reduction, standardization of all systems, duplication of critically important units and competent spare parts/biomaterials procurement planning are important.
