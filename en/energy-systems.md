# Platform Energy Systems

## Energy Supply Concept

The platform's energy system is built on renewable sources (wave, wind, solar) with a backup emergency diesel generator. All energy is distributed between life support, propulsion, production, domestic needs, and emergency requirements through a system of priority loads and accumulation.

## Main Energy Sources

### Wave Energy (OWC)

- 12 oscillating water columns (OWC chambers) integrated into the platform's support columns.
- Maximum peak power at 2.5 m wave height — up to 560 kW; in real conditions — 150–400 kW.
- Used to power propeller screws (platform movement), electricity generation, battery charging, as well as low and high pressure pneumatic systems.
- **Key innovation:**  
    - Air from the OWC chamber passes through passive "Tesla valves" that separate flows and directs them to two independent "unidirectional" turbines (or to one with two inputs).
    - This avoids losses on the reverse stroke, increases efficiency, reduces vibrations, and uses maximally simple mechanics.
    - Part of the flow (through a special line with a check valve) goes directly to pneumatic drive — for low-pressure compressor/pump (tools) and high-pressure (scuba tank charging).
- Turbines have independent circuits and can work for electricity generation and/or directly drive a mechanical compressor (switching — automatic or manual).

### Wind Energy (Magnus Rotors)

- 3 vertical Magnus rotors (2.5 × 12 m), self-spinning or driven by a small wind wheel.
- Generation: 20–60 kW at wind speeds of 8–14 m/s.
- Used for propulsion (thrust to screws/electric generator), battery charging, and electrical grid.

### Solar Generation

- Photovoltaic panels with total capacity of 20 kW (placement — roofs, greenhouses, technical blocks).
- Covers daily domestic and service loads, backup power for pumps and UPS for critical systems.

### Emergency Diesel Generator

- 20–25 kW, in backup power circuit.
- Fuel reserve for 2–3 years of emergency operation.
- Used only during prolonged absence of renewable generation, for system startup and maintaining minimum consumers.

## Accumulation and Distribution

- Battery buffer 200–300 kWh.
- Priority hierarchy: Level I — life support, farm, communications; Level II — propulsion, climate; Level III — domestic.
- Possibility of flexible power distribution reconfiguration: all energy to propulsion (storm), or to critical systems during calm periods.

## Innovative OWC Generation Scheme

- Classical OWC turbines replaced with **dual-channel schemes with Tesla valves**:  
    - On wave rise phase, air flow goes through one channel, on decline — through the second, each through its own "unidirectional" turbogenerator.
    - This ensures maximum efficiency, reduces mechanical wear and vibrations.
    - No moving dampers, all work on aerodynamics of form (eternal and fail-safe).
- **Pneumatic energy:**
    - Part of air doesn't go to turbine but switches (by automation command) to mechanical pneumatic drive compressor:
        - **Low pressure** (5–8 bar) — for powering tools, workshop, technological needs.
        - **High pressure** (up to 200 bar) — for refilling scuba tanks and emergency breathing systems.
    - Pumps work from mechanical transmission with OWC turbine (cam/gearbox scheme), or directly from excess pressure in the circuit.
    - Built-in safety valves and pressure safety control system.
- Remains possibility to simultaneously conduct electricity generation and compressed air tank charging.

## Parameters and Energy Balance

- Total generation: 200–300 kW (typical mode), up to 560 kW (storm peak).
- Daily energy consumption: 70–120 kWh (depending on mode and season).
- Autonomy reserve: 2 days at standard consumption on batteries, up to 5 days — in economy mode.
- Platform can develop 4–6 knots in motion, combining thrust from OWC and Magnus rotors.
- All emergency power reserve is maintained by diesel generator (20–25 kW, fuel reserve for 2–3 years).

---

## Control, Automation, Maintainability

- Dispatching of all generators and batteries with priorities and automatic/manual control.
- Quick switching of "generation — pneumatics — mechanical drive" circuits.
- Critical power lines are duplicated; backup for all emergency scenarios (two independent buses).
- Equipment and automation standardized for quick onboard maintenance and repair.
- Spare parts inventory for all power plants and pneumatic systems — for at least 2 years of operation.

## Connection with Other Systems

- Life support (water, farm, communications, lighting) — always in power priority.
- Biofarm has its own line, works from main and emergency battery (36 hours in isolation).
- Pneumatic systems ensure tool operation, support workshop and emergency breathing systems.

## Conclusions

The platform's energy system ensures not only a complete autonomous cycle, but also unique flexibility and sustainability due to innovative OWC generators with bidirectional channels, passive Tesla valves, mechanical and pneumatic output. All this minimizes risks, reduces operating costs, and allows quick response to any changes in sea conditions and crew tasks.
