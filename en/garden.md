# Bio-plant Plan for Autonomous Marine Platform (15 people)

## 1. Principles and Plant Selection Criteria

- All cultures selected considering:
    - Sun exposure, salt spray, strong wind
    - Limited soil layer (mounds, containers, vertical plantings)
    - Minimal care, high resistance
- **Special criterion for perennials:**  
    - Not have pronounced winter dormancy  
    - Not require cold/short day for flowering and fruiting  
    - Be capable of year-round growth, flowering and harvest in tropics/subtropics  
    - Be genetically "evergreen," not cause pause even with constant summer

## 3. Berries and Citrus — Year-round Harvest Organization

### 3.1 Berries:
- Use only everbearing and day-neutral varieties, plant in "waves" every 2–3 months.
- Strawberry, raspberry, blackberry — always have fruiting, rejuvenating and young bushes.
- Rejuvenation and rotation: renew plantings with runners and offshoots every 2–3 years.

### 3.2 Citrus:
- Dwarf lemon, lime, kumquat, calamondin, mandarin (satsuma, clementines) — best for container and pot culture.
- Bloom and fruit in waves without winter dormancy.
- Maintain regular feeding, drainage and soil change.

---

## 4. Practical Areas

---

## 5. Growing Recommendations

- **Multi-tier and mixed plantings:** trees–shrubs–herbs–ground covers.
- **Containers and pots:** mobility, ability to protect plants during storms, change microclimate.
- **Vertical systems:** for berries, vines, greens — space saving.
- **Constant rejuvenation and cutting:** especially for berries and herbs.
- **Selection of "ever-bearing" varieties:** only without pronounced dormancy, adapted for subtropics/tropics.
- **Wind and salt protection:** halophytes and succulents along edges.

---

## 6. Approximate Vitamin and Microelement Supply
