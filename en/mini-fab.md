# Mini-factory and Autonomous Production Processes

## Purpose

The mini-factory ensures manufacturing of key platform structures, autonomous repair and technical support, as well as production of consumables, parts and new modules for all platform systems — without the need for regular recourse to external contractors.

## Main Production Capabilities

- **Foam glass manufacturing** (blocks for columns, insulation, panels).
- **Mechanical processing**: cutting, drilling, milling of metal and composite profiles.
- **Module assembly**: welding, riveting, bolt connections.
- **Composite element production**: molding parts from fiberglass, basalt mesh and epoxy resins.
- **Plastic production and processing**:  
  — Crushing, extrusion and molding from waste/purchased polymers,  
  — 3D printing (simple parts, fittings, cases, fasteners),  
  — Repair of plastic and composite elements by welding/adhesives.
- **Electrochemical processes**:  
  — Simple galvanics for part coating (zinc, copper, nickel),  
  — Battery recharging or repair (electrolyte, basic elements),  
  — Water electrolysis for hydrogen and oxygen production (when necessary),  
  — Production and regeneration of technical fluids and solutions for system maintenance.
- **Manufacturing and repair of engineering systems**: cable installation, pipes, small hydraulic and pneumatic units, creating seals, fasteners, gaskets.
- **Workshop**: universal set of machines, tools and tooling for operative repair of entire equipment fleet.

## Equipment and Tools

- **Furnace and reactor for foam glass** (on electricity, biogas or diesel).
- **Machines**: band saw, drilling, milling table, hand router, cutters.
- **3D printer**: FDM (PLA/ABS/PETG) with possibility of extruder repair or replacement on site.
- **Extruder/granulator for plastics**: for secondary raw material production from fragments, packaging and waste.
- **Galvanic bath, DC source for electrochemistry**.
- **Battery work kit**: tester, charger, materials for overhaul.
- **Welding equipment**: inverter/gas welding, plastic soldering stations.
- **Engineering network assembly kits**: pipe bender, press, hand and power tools.
- **Mechanics**: presses, clamps, templates, dies, tooling for molding and assembly.

## Production Processes

- **Foam glass production**: charge loading, melting, molding in dies, finishing.
- **Plastic production**:  
  — Plastic crushing, melting, extrusion, molding, 3D printing of products (farm parts, fittings, small housings).
- **Electrochemistry**:  
  — Metal coating (anti-corrosion, contact surfaces),  
  — Technical fluid production (solutions, electrolytes),  
  — Battery recharging, minor repair (electrolyte replacement, balancing).
- **Metal structures**: welding and assembly of frames, mounting trusses, fastening units.
- **Unit and block assembly**: modular assembly of panels, integration with platform engineering systems.
- **Small parts and repair**: operative manufacturing of spare parts, fasteners, gaskets, bushings and bearings.

## Labor Costs and Organization

- Team: 8–12 people (technologist, furnace operator, installers, assemblers, electrician, biofarm engineer, generalists).
- Operations standardized and described in technological maps; quick training of new specialists.
- Production and repair conducted during "quiet" operation periods, module reserve created in advance.

---

## Autonomy and Reserves

- **Consumables:** glass cullet, soda, sand, foaming agent, basic plastics, metal stock, resins, fiberglass, reinforcement — reserve for 3+ years of work.
- **Plastic:** part of raw material regenerated from own waste, part — purchased in batches (granules, printer spools).
- **Electrochemistry:** minimal set of salts, acids, electrolytes for annual work; simplest processing and solution regeneration.
- **Tools:** minimum 2 sets of basic hand tools, consumable reserve for 2–3 years.

## Repair and Modernization Capabilities

- Any structural element can be replaced or manufactured anew — quick disassembly units designed.
- New modules, engineering blocks, containers and parts for farms, life support and energy created on site.
- All engineering systems standardized for local repair: pipes, fittings, housings, gaskets — everything compatible with factory capabilities.

---

## Interaction with Other Systems

- Manufacturing and repair of tanks, fittings, containers, biofarm units.
- Production/modernization of energy parts (supports, housings, impellers), farm (cassettes, trays), engineering networks.
- Hull panel repair, insulation replacement, manufacturing interior parts, furniture, household inventory.

## Conclusions

The platform mini-factory guarantees independence in construction, repair and modernization, ensures 2–3 years of independent work without external supplies, allows producing and restoring parts of any key systems, maintaining sustainable platform operation even during prolonged isolation from "mainland."
