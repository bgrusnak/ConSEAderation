# Closed Cycles of Household Chemicals and Hygiene Materials for Autonomous Platform

## 1. **Criteria and Principles**

* **Complete reproducibility**: everything produced on platform from local resources or byproduct flows.
* **Ecological safety**: only biodegradable and safe for septic microflora substances.
* **Minimal waste**: maximum closed material flows, byproducts return to biocycles or technical processes.
* **Integration with energy system and desalination**: brine and organic byproduct flows participate in new cycles.

## 2. **Main Closed Cycles**

### 2.1. **"Soap – Alkali – Fat" Cycle**

* **Raw material**: plant/animal fats (kitchen waste, goats, fish), alkali (NaOH/KOH from brine electrolysis).
* **Process**: saponification → soap and glycerin.
* **Use**: soap for hygiene, laundry, cleaning.
* **Disposal**: soap residues completely decompose in septic/compost, glycerin — for ointments and technical processes.

### 2.2. **"Plant Surfactants – Cleaning – Compost" Cycle**

* **Raw material**: saponin-containing plants (sapindus, soapwort, yucca, legumes, quinoa).
* **Process**: saponin extraction (soaking, boiling, pressing).
* **Use**: cleaning solutions for dishes, laundry, hygiene.
* **Disposal**: residues go to compost or re-extraction, then decompose completely.

#### **Plant Selection Recommendation:**

* **Main source:** Sapindus mukorossi ("soapnut") — two trees of different sexes in containers.
* **Backup source:** 2 m² soapwort (Saponaria officinalis).

**Demand Coverage:**

* 2 trees + 2 m² soapwort = 0.95–1.9 kg saponins/year → 100–200% household platform needs (for 15 people).

### 2.3. **"Biocellulose/paper – Disposable Hygiene – Compost" Cycle**

* **Raw material**: bacterial cellulose, amaranth, moringa, bamboo.
* **Process**: paper, napkin, pad production.
* **Use**: disposable hygiene products.
* **Disposal**: composting, return to biocycle.

### 2.4. **"Hypochlorite – Disinfection – Water – Electrolysis" Cycle**

* **Raw material**: brine after desalination (concentrated NaCl).
* **Process**: electrolysis → NaClO, NaOH, H₂, Cl₂, Mg(OH)₂/Ca(OH)₂ precipitates.
* **Use**: disinfection, alkali and reagent production.
* **Disposal**: chlorine and hypochlorite decompose, water residues return to system, precipitates used as fertilizers or in technical processes.

#### **Brine Integration Features:**

* **Increased reagent yield** (more NaCl — more NaOH, Cl₂, NaClO with same energy).
* **Byproduct compound extraction** (Mg, Ca) for fertilizers.
* **Minimal overboard discharge** — all brine goes to production or disposal.

### 2.5. **"Microbial Enzymes – Cleaning Solutions – Biofarm" Cycle**

* **Raw material**: waste, growing enzyme producers (lipases, proteases).
* **Process**: fermentation, extraction.
* **Use**: enzyme cleaners, biodegradable and septic-safe.
* **Disposal**: enzymes completely decompose, biomass — to compost.

### 2.6. **"Bioplastics – Disposable Containers – Compost/biogas" Cycle**

* **Raw material**: bacterial cultures, algae → PHB, PHA.
* **Process**: molding, forming containers, hygiene products.
* **Use**: containers, packaging, disposable brushes and sponges.
* **Disposal**: composting or fermentation, everything returns to carbon cycle.

### 2.7. **"Ash – Alkali – Soap/Cleaning – Septic" Cycle**

* **Raw material**: ash from organic burning.
* **Process**: alkali, soap, mild cleaning agent production.
* **Disposal**: completely biodegradable, mineral residue goes to fertilizer.

## 3. **Production Features for Septic Systems**

* All recipes adapted so as **not to suppress beneficial microflora**:

  * Base — plant saponins, fat-based soap, enzyme solutions.
  * Hypochlorite and chlorine-containing — only for emergency disinfection (without entering septic).
* **Each new product — test on small batch** before mass use (see biodegradability testing section).

---

## 4. **Optimization Using Desalination Brine**

* **Concentrated brine electrolysis**:

  * Increases NaOH, NaClO, Cl₂ production efficiency.
  * Mg/Ca precipitates can be used for fertilizers and chemistry.
  * Entire salt and water cycle maximally closed — minimal discharge.
* **Advantages**: more reagents with same energy, less waste, new mineral flows.

## 6. **Summary and Recommendations**

* **Critical positions completely covered**: cleaners, disinfection, disposable hygiene, containers — all reproducible.
* **Two sapindus + 2 m² soapwort** provide 100–200% household saponin needs.
* **Desalination + brine electrolysis** make cycle maximally efficient and closed, with minimal waste.
* **Focus on biodegradability and biosystem safety** — no industrial surfactants, only saponins, enzymes, alkalis, bio- and organics.
* **Failure preparedness** — duplication of saponin plant cultures, backup fat-based soap, laboratory biodegradability control.
