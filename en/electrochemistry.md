# Electrochemistry and Electrotechnologies

## Brief Description
The platform uses electrochemical methods to obtain essential reagents (chlorine, alkali, hypochlorite, hydrogen, oxygen), galvanics and electrodeposition for component repair and water purification.

## Main Directions

- **Seawater electrolysis:** production of chlorine, hypochlorite, alkali (NaOH), hydrogen and oxygen
- **Galvanics, electrodeposition:** restoration and repair of metal contacts, corrosion protection, component coating, growing metal structures
- **Electroorganic synthesis:** production of hydrogen peroxide, bleach, biocides
- **EDM (electrical discharge machining):** drilling, burning through hard materials, for tool repair

## Equipment

- Electrodes: graphite (batteries, rods), iron, copper
- Reactors and tanks — plastic/PVC
- Power supply — solar inverter, batteries, rheostat

## Final Conclusions

- Electrochemistry is critically important for autonomy, sanitation, repair, fuel production, disinfection
- All equipment can be assembled and serviced on site, except graphite electrodes — reserve stock recommended

## Risks and Recommendations

- Store reserve of electrodes, membranes, reagents
- Observe safety procedures when working with chlorine, alkali and hydrogen
