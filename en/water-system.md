# Platform Water Supply and Recirculation System

## General Concept

The entire water system on the platform is based on the principle of complete autonomy and maintainability:  
no high-tech membranes, deep reverse osmosis or expensive consumables.  
Water is extracted exclusively through **low-temperature distillation** (solar and/or using waste heat), further purified by maximally simple and accessible methods, then returned to a closed cycle.

## Water Sources and Extraction Methods

### 1. Solar Distillation

- **Main desalinator** — solar evaporators (solar roofs, domes, greenhouses, "salt ponds" with transparent covering and inclined condensation panels).
- Uses heat from direct sunlight and warm air above greenhouse roof; condensate is collected on inclined panels and goes to clean tank.
- Possible integration with transparent greenhouse roofs, verandas and technological facilities.
- Productivity — average 3–7 l/day per 1 m² evaporator (depending on climate, inclination angle, covering transparency and source water salinity).
- For emergency mode, "field" evaporators are possible — black containers + canvas + condensate collector.

### 2. Flow Multi-stage Distillation

- Uses excess heat from power plant operation (OWC, biogas, engine) — classic evaporator "cascades" connected in series.
- Basic principle — part of water evaporates in first circuit, heat exchanger heats second and third, output — condensate collection and brine return flow.
- Can work at minimum temperature — 50–70°C (easily achievable even on simple metal parts and pipes).
- Pre-treatment: only coarse filter (sand, gravel) to prevent large organics entry.

### 3. Rainwater and Condensate

- Entire building roof, exterior surfaces and even exterior greenhouse glass equipped with storm drains for rain collection.
- Water collected in technical reservoirs, can be used for irrigation, floor washing, emergency technical system refill.
- In high humidity conditions (tropics, rainy season) — main supplement for distillate conservation.

### 4. Emergency Distillation/Boiling

- In case of emergency (no sun, no heat) — manual boilers, buckets and steam collection on simple surfaces: over fire, biogas burner, or electric stove from emergency generator.
- Low productivity, but sufficient for emergency drinking and injection needs.

## Recirculation and Secondary Use

- **Technical and "gray" water** (from washbasins, showers, laundry, washing, farm) collected separately, passes coarse filtration (mesh/sand/biofilter), part used again for irrigation, wet cleaning, equipment cooling.
- **Black water** (toilets) undergoes separation, biofiltration, part of liquid evaporates on solar areas, remainder is further treated for household needs or discharged only after safe composting.
- **Condensate from engineering systems** (climate, ventilation, "sweating" pipes) also returned to circulation.
- **80–90%** of all consumed water returns to circulation, new losses compensated only by distillation.

## Storage and Emergency Reserves

- Main drinking water reservoir — hermetic tanks, 1.5–2 daily standards for everyone.
- Each resident has emergency reserve in cabin (canister, filter pump).
- Technical water stored in separate tanks for irrigation, washing and emergency fire suppression.

## Purification and Post-treatment

- **Filtration**:  
    — Everywhere uses coarse reusable filters (sand, gravel, fabric) that can be washed and completely restored.
- **Disinfection**:  
    — For drinking: UV lamp, ozonizer, or boiling when necessary.
    — Mineralization (adding mineral mixture if pure distillate).
- **Recommendation**: Always keep set of express tests for microbiological condition and general water quality control.

## Water Consumption and Balance

- **Average daily requirement (15 people):**
    — Drinking and cooking — 45–60 l
    — Hygiene — 1200–1800 l
    — Biofarm — 200–500 l
    — Technical needs — 40–80 l
    — Total: 1485–2440 l/day

- **Losses:**  
    — Evaporation, emergency discharge — up to 10–15%, compensated by distillation or rainwater.
    — Main balance — "conservation and return", minimum 80% water returns to circulation after treatment.

## Automation, Emergency Mode and Maintainability

- Entire system designed for manual/mechanical mode: all pumps can be replaced with "manual" ones, all filters — dismountable.
- Desalination panels, roofs and ponds — simple covering replacement, quick operability restoration.
- Automation — only for flow control, level, temperature, but entire process can be conducted manually.
- System has no "bottlenecks" — even with any part failure, drinking water can be collected using pot and canvas.

## Additional Suggestions and Ideas

- **Recommendation**: Provide possibility to expand solar evaporator area (removable panels, portable ponds, awnings).
- **Idea**: Integrate condensate collection from ventilation system (high humidity inside farm — additional fresh water source).
- **Addition**: Use heat pumps or air conditioners for "active" condensate production under excess electricity conditions.

## Risks and Recommendations

- Main risk — evaporator and reservoir contamination, biofilm growth, evaporation with productivity decrease.
- Loss of roof transparency or inclined panel breakage — quick replacement from improvised materials.
- Under low solar activity conditions — water transition to "military mode" (conservation, minimal hygiene procedures, maximum secondary use).
- Always keep reserve of sand, gravel, glass/film pieces, fabric filters, buckets and hoses for manual collection and filtration.

## Conclusion

The platform's water supply system is built on principles of strict autonomy, minimizing consumables, complete maintainability and maximum water return to cycle. Only this ensures crew and biosystem survival even with complete disconnection from "mainland" and any weather anomalies.
