# Biopolymers, Organics and Production Cycles

## General Concept

This block is designed to describe the production, processing and use of bioplastics, technical organics, biodegradable materials and related technological processes that support the closed material cycle of the platform, independence of production, repair and economic activities.

## Raw Material Sources and Flows

- **Biomass**: waste from hydro- and aquaponics, plant trimmings, spent substrates, organic fractions of kitchen and farm waste.
- **Algae**: microalgae biomass (spirulina, chlorella, dunaliella), part — emergency feed base, part — raw material for technical needs.
- **Animal waste**: manure, poultry droppings, guinea pigs and pigs, fractions after biogas installations.
- **Fungi and worms**: vermicompost and fungal mass as organics for biodegradation and substrate regeneration.

## Main Products and Semi-finished Products

- **Bioplastics**:  
    — Polylactide (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), starch-containing plastics  
    — Forming containers, packaging, parts for technical systems  
    — 3D printing consumables, cases, tooling, fittings  
    — Sheets and "bio-plywood" for partitions, housings, small engineering solutions
- **Biodegradable materials**:  
    — Fibers for ropes, nets, bags  
    — Bio-packaging for storage/transport  
    — Filters, gaskets, plumbing elements
- **Biogas**:  
    — From organic waste/manure — fuel for emergency needs (stove, mini-CHP, heating, cooking)  
    — Secondary fraction after biogas installation goes to compost/fertilizers  
- **Technical organics**:  
    — Bio-resins for hull and structure repair  
    — Bio-adhesives for small assembly work  
    — Starch pastes, cellulose films

## Technological Cycles

- **Biogas installation**:  
    — Maintains energy for low-temperature processes (drying, heating), part of heat — to farm, part — to technological tasks.
- **Plastic production**:  
    — Raw material collection, cleaning, fermentation/hydrolysis, polymerization, forming and/or extrusion, 3D printing.
- **Plastic regeneration**:  
    — Waste collection, sorting, crushing, re-extrusion or melting for 3D printing new products.
- **Fibers and textiles**:  
    — Obtained from plants (jute, flax, bamboo, microalgae), integration into composites, making ropes, nets.

## Equipment List

- Reactor for fermentation and biopolymer synthesis (bioreactor, hydrolyzer).
- Extruder for plastic filaments/granules, 3D printer with possibility of nozzle replacement.
- Presses for forming sheets, simple housings, small containers.
- Biogas installation (modules for manure, organic waste).
- Composter with temperature control and ventilation.

---

## Autonomy and Reserves

- Chemicals, enzymes, catalysts — reserve for minimum 2 years (or alternative possibility of regeneration and on-site production).
- Granules/blanks for printer and small molding tooling — reserve for emergency repair and critical components.
- All processes designed for operation with minimal personnel qualification; simple instructions, quick retraining.

---

## Application and Integration

- All organic flow maximally returns to cycles: after biogas — to compost and fertilizer, after plastic processing — to secondary raw materials.
- All bioplastics and organics compatible with sanitary and food standards (when possible), do not release harmful substances in contact with water/food.
- Use for small hull repairs, technical seals, temporary part prosthetics, creating tooling and non-standard devices.

---

## Risks and Limitations

- Possible instability of technological processes during prolonged isolation (catalyst aging, culture loss).
- Limited quality and strength of some "biomaterials" compared to industrial polymers — consider in design.
- Critical to maintain "raw material — processing — use — disposal" chain for system sustainability.
- Requires regular rotation and renewal of enzymes/catalysts, plastic reserves, as well as biological cultures (when possible).

---

## Recommendations and New Opportunities (added based on dialogue results)

- **Recommendation:** Equip mini-factory with simplest laboratory for "growing" technical bacteria (for PHA/PHB and enzyme synthesis), with microbiological control.
- **Recommendation:** Consider scheme for using plastics with different degradation rates — for "fast" packaging materials and "long-lasting" (hull parts, technical fittings).
- **New opportunity:** With large biogas reserve — use it to power foam glass furnace and/or emergency water heating.
- **New idea:** Implement system of organic/bioplastic marking and sorting by color/barcodes to speed automatic sorting for disposal or regeneration.
- **New opportunity:** Use microalgae not only as feed, but also as raw material for bio-resins and "bio-epoxy" for composite structure repair.
- **Recommendation:** Include sanitary control (analysis of absence of toxic metabolites in biomaterials before application in food or water chains).

## Conclusion

The biopolymer and organics production and processing system provides the platform with maximum independence from external supplies, reduces waste, increases repairability and allows "closing" key technological and domestic autonomy tasks even during prolonged isolation.
