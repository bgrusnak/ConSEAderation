# Platform Construction and Building

## General Concept

The platform is designed for long-term autonomous operation in open sea. The main principle is an integral load-bearing system, maximum maintainability without loss of tightness and safety, integration of engineering systems at the structure molding stage.

## Platform

- **Shape:** regular hexagon, edge length 20 m, diameter across vertices ~40 m.
- **Construction:**  
  — **Integral honeycomb plate** made of reinforced foam glass,  
  — 80% internal volume — honeycomb cavities (hermetic, with possibility of tightness control and purging),  
  — Bottom plate thickness — 20 cm, top — 15 cm,  
  — External shell and top layer reinforced with fiberglass/basalt plastic, all technological openings sealed with covers.
- **Rigidity and strength:**  
  — External and internal reinforcement,  
  — Honeycomb structure provides maximum stability with minimum weight and ensures damage localization.
  - In the platform near the center, a 2×8 meter hatch is cut with automatically opening upward doors along the long side (with rising guard rail on the side distant from the stair junction), under which is located a four-flight stair made of foam glass attached to one of the short sides and lowered on tackles with a mooring platform on the lower edge, which in raised state fits flush into the platform body, and when lowered allows docking and boarding the platform.
  - Near the stair hatch, a 3×4 meter hatch is cut, also with folding door-guards, above which a rotating tackle is installed, allowing lifting or lowering up to two tons of cargo in a net.

## Columns and Floats

- **Main load-bearing elements:**  
  — 6 columns evenly distributed around the hexagon, column centers located at 4/9 distance from radius to platform center,
  — Columns **cast entirely** from reinforced foam glass (without sectioning),  
  — Column length — 12 m, of which **6 m submerged** underwater,
  — Column cross-section - ellipse 5.2×1.7 meters, divided into two air chambers for OWC generation at the ends and an elevator shaft 2.40 long and width of the ellipse width,
  - Columns oriented in one direction, along the conditional platform axis,
  — Reinforcement — basalt mesh or composite strands,  
  — Column contains shafts for elevator, engineering communications, sensors and emergency systems.
- **Floats:**  
  — Under each column — **truncated spherical cone** (top — to column, base — to bottom),  
  — Made of reinforced composite (foam glass + basalt),  
  — Provide additional buoyancy, compensate draft with load changes, dampen rolling, reduce movement resistance.
- **Connections:**  
  — Columns attached to platform through rigid reinforced sockets and additionally fixed inside platform honeycomb,  
  — Access to engineering cavities — through hermetic hatches inside building.

## Two-story Building Around Platform Perimeter

### General Parameters

- **Location:**  
  — Building "encircles" the platform's outer perimeter,  
  — First floor 8 meters wide, second floor — 4 meters, both floors form a ring.
- **Construction:**  
  — Building monolithic, made of reinforced foam glass,  
  — External wall — direct continuation of platform outer edge (without protruding balconies and bay windows),  
  — Internal wall of first floor — set back 8 m from external, second floor — 4 m from external,  
  — Second floor terrace (4 m wide) oriented ONLY toward platform center, covered and landscaped,  
  — Glazing: external walls — 20% area, internal (facing courtyard/terrace) — 80%.

### Layout

#### Second Floor (residential)

- 8 double occupancy sections of 24 m² with bathrooms (4 in each "wing" on both sides of section),  
- 8 single occupancy sections of 18 m² with bathrooms,  
- Storage rooms, wardrobes,  
- Work offices, library, medical station, server room, technical facilities,  
- Internal "gallery" overlooking terrace/courtyard.

#### First Floor (public)

- Kitchen, dining room, wardroom (dining hall, recreation hall),  
- Warehouses, cold storage,  
- Workshop, utility block,  
- Biofarm: hydroponics, aquaponics, mushroom, livestock zones,  
- Internal courtyard/terrace with possibility of installing pool, sports area, "winter garden."

### Communications

- All communications run vertically through columns (elevator shafts, air ducts, engineering risers), then through ring technical corridors on each floor.
- Designed emergency routes (sector isolation), sealing of key zones.

## Energy and Engineering Systems

- Generators (OWC, Magnus rotors, solar panels, generator sets) integrated into technical facilities of first floor and columns.
- Main engineering networks — in under-deck space and building technical niches,  
- Ventilation, heating, air conditioning — with sector backup.

---

## Propulsion and Drives

- Azimuthal column-propellers located between main columns, integrated into platform "skirt."
- Drive — electromechanical with gearbox; motors installed in platform hull, shaft passes through column on bearings.
- All units — maintainable, can be replaced without lifting platform to dock.

---

## Production and Repair

- All structures adapted for own production at platform mini-factory:  
  — foam glass, composites, metal trusses,  
  — block and part molding according to pre-developed maps,  
  — repair and module replacement performed on site.
- All engineering systems standardized, mounting parts — on bolts/threads/quick-release connections.

---

## Safety and Stability

- All main structural elements designed with double safety factor for strength and buoyancy.
- Emergency ballasting and compartment sealing system.
- All building blocks connected to platform so that in case of depressurization or damage there is no "chain reaction" throughout the structure.

## Conclusion

Such platform construction ensures strength, autonomy, high maintainability and adaptation to life and work in open ocean conditions, with maximum protection of crew and all engineering systems.
