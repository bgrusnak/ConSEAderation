## About the Project

The SWAHH platform (Small Waterplane Area Hex Hull) is designed for 15 permanent residents and represents a completely autonomous system capable of multi-year operation without external support. Key principles:

- **Complete autonomy** — closed cycles of water, energy, nutrition and materials
- **Maintainability** — all systems can be serviced and repaired on-site
- **Resilience** — backup of critical systems and emergency modes
- **Scalability** — modular architecture for expansion and modernization
