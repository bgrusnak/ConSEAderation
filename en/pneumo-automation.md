# Pneumatic and Hydro-automation

## Brief Description
The entire platform is automated using pneumatics and hydro-automation. This guarantees control of engineering networks even without electricity, increases maintainability and resistance to salt water, moisture, and fires.

## Key Elements

- **Pneumatic valves and relays** for water, air, biogas, sewage, irrigation, ventilation
- **Pneumatic actuators for dampers, hatches, doors**
- **Pneumatic signaling and emergency systems** (pressure gauges, sirens, mechanical indicators)
- **Pneumonics** High-speed (kilohertz) logic based on Coandă effect. (AND, OR, NOT, timers, reversers, sequential commands)

## Technology

- All components implemented with membranes, jets, plastic and metal tubes, valves
- Minimal "unique" import: membranes, calibrated jets, durable springs
- Simple logic possible without electronics — for all emergency and critical processes

## Final Conclusions

- Allows automation and control of all critical platform equipment without electronics and even in emergency situations
- Everything maximally maintainable, standardized, replaceable "on the knee"

## Risks and Recommendations

- Requires storage and replenishment of membrane, jet, repair kit reserves
- Regular diagnostics — cleaning, part replacement due to wear
