## Architecture and Construction

* **Geometry:**
  Hexagon (edge 20 m), platform thickness 2 m, honeycomb construction (20% volume filled), load-bearing top layer — 10 cm, bottom — 30 cm.
  External ring residential zone: 1st floor — 8 m wide, 2nd floor — 4 m. Terraces, cornices, canopies, garden, sports area, pool.
* **Columns:**
  6 ellipsoidal columns at platform vertices.
  Each column — large volume OWC chamber, provides buoyancy and stability.
  Height 12 m, ellipsoidal cross-section (dimensions see platform-construction.md), with dry compartment, shaft, rigid bulkhead.
  Floats — truncated ellipsoidal cones with hemispherical bottom, provide buoyancy reserve and level waterline.
* **Materials:**
  Foam glass with basalt fiber reinforcement (fiber produced on-site), all large structures — casting only.
  Modules and molds reusable, part of tooling — foam glass, plastic or metal.
* **Construction:**
  Layer-by-layer structure growth using solar concentrators (40–80 m² mirrors) and mini-furnace; possible assembly on unequipped shore.
  Mini-shop for repair and production of all elements (see mini-fab.md).

## Energy

* **Wave generation (OWC):**
  All 6 ellipsoidal columns work as OWC chambers.
  System produces **from 100 to 500 kW** at wave peak, base generation — 20–60 kW (see energy-systems.md).
  Two-chamber valves, double turbine scheme, part of flow to compressor for pneumatic network.
* **Solar concentrators:**
  80–85 m² mirrors, efficiency ~60%, up to 40–45 kW thermal power (water heating, desalination, tech processes).
* **Solar panels:**
  5–10 kW (all excess power — to accumulation and water heating).
* **Biogas and biofuel:**
  Generation based on biofarm, energy reserve support.
* **Accumulation:**
  Iron-nickel batteries (up to 1,200 kWh), pneumatic accumulators (up to 300 kWh, 2,000 m³ × 12 atm).
* **Backup and repair:**
  All energy built on reproducible components, load control — automation and pneumatic drives.

## Water Supply and Desalination

* **Desalinator:**
  Vacuum cascade distillation, 2–3 m³/day (at 40 m² mirrors), up to 0.5 m³/day rainwater.
* **Reservoirs:**
  At least 50 m³ fresh water reserve.
* **Recirculation:**
  "Gray" water cleaned and goes to irrigation/technical needs.
  Separate fire network (on seawater), PVC/stainless/brass.
* **Automation:**
  Pneumatic drives and membrane level sensors, emergency systems with floats.

  Guinea pigs (8+), goats (2×4), Vietnamese pigs (2×4), poultry (3 lines), fish (sturgeon, tilapia, etc.), insectarium (insects), worms.
* **Plants:**
  Up to 300 m² hydro- and aquaponics (see aquaponic-algae.md, garden.md).
  Vegetables, greens, tubers, berries (everbearing), fruit trees, halophytes around perimeter, tropical and unusual species.
  Multi-tier, container, vertical plantings, dwarf trees.
* **Microalgae:**
  1–1.5 m³ photobioreactors (spirulina, chlorella), up to 3.5 tons biomass per year, up to 50% feed for animals and fish.
* **Fungi:**
  On organic remains, additional protein, composites.
* **Cycles:**
  All waste goes to compost, insects, algae or biogas; closed nutrition and fertilizer cycle.

## Household Chemicals and Hygiene

* **Closed cycles:**
  Soap — from fats and NaOH (brine electrolysis).
  Surfactants — from saponin-containing plants (sapindus, soapwort).
  Cellulose and paper — from amaranth, moringa, microbial cellulose.
  Hypochlorite for disinfection — from brine after desalination.
