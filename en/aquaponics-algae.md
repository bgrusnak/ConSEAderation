# Aquaponics, Algae and Related Biotechnologies

## General Scheme and System Tasks

The system combines aquaponics, hydroponics and microalgae cultivation in closed resource exchange for:
- Obtaining fish and plant products (food, feed, fertilizer)
- Microalgae production (protein, fatty acids, vitamins, feed, emergency food)
- Biofiltration and balance maintenance in water and mineral cycle of entire platform
- Using aqua- and hydroponic products for feeding animals, fungi, worms and maintaining biodegradation

## Key Parameters and Volumes

- **Total aquaponics water body:** 10–15 m³ (several reservoirs for different species)
- **Fish species composition:** minimum 3–4 lines per breed (sturgeon, tilapia, carp and/or catfish — clarify by market and sustainability), rotation and renewal.
- **Stocking density:** up to 60 kg/m³, but with regular unloading/catching according to plan.
- **Hydroponic areas:** up to 300 m² integrated planting (green crops, vegetables, root crops, feed plants).
- **Microalgae bioreactors:** 1–1.5 m³ active volume (spirulina, chlorella, other promising strains), up to 3 tons dry biomass per year.

## Matter and Energy Flows

- **Nutrient water** from fish and biofarm — goes to hydroponic beds where plants extract nitrogen, phosphorus, microelements.
- **Water after hydroponics** filtered (biofilters, vermiculture), returns to aquariums, part goes to technical needs.
- **Organics (sediments, waste fractions)** — composted, go to mushroom farm/vermiculture or to animal feed.
- **Microalgae**:
    - Used as feed for fish, poultry, guinea pigs, human diet supplement, source of fats and vitamins (especially B12, Omega-3, beta-carotene)
    - Serve as emergency food source, added to compost, go to fertilizer/soil for plants

## Biofiltration, Balance, Automation

- Biofiltration system built on "living" filters (bacterial colonies, vermiculture), ensuring sustainable organic decomposition and ammonia/nitrite/nitrate balance maintenance.
- Constant monitoring of key parameters: pH, EC, water temperature, oxygen, ammonia/nitrite content, biomass.
- Entire system controlled by automation with emergency manual mode:
    - Feed sensors, signaling, automatic correction (nitrite spike — emergency drain/water replacement/sorbent addition)
    - With automation failure, transition to manual operation and control by express tests possible.
- Regular water rotation by sections (against silting), introduction of "resting" reservoirs.

## Cultivation and Harvesting

- **Fish**: in batches, according to schedule, to maintain juveniles and stable bioload; part goes to salting/preservation.
- **Microalgae**: collection and drying every 1–2 days, part of mass goes to direct consumption, part — to strategic reserve and feed mixture.
- **Hydroponics**: by crops — greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, root crops — according to "continuous turnover" scheme ensuring daily diet freshness.
- **Organics**: waste processing, composting, part goes to mushroom/worm cultivation.

## Relationship with Other Biosystems

- Aquaponics closely connected with livestock modules (part of water and organics circulates between sections).
- Vermiculture and mushroom farm close "organic circle," accelerating decomposition and nutrient medium regeneration.
- Microalgae serve as emergency nutrition buffer, compensate any protein and vitamin failures.

---

## Operating Modes

- **Standard:** fully automated, with regular crop and fish rotation.
- **Economy:** reduced harvest, decreased fish and plant density, transfer of part of volume to conservation.
- **Emergency:** focus on microalgae and fast-growing crops, manual control, transition to backup nutrition and water maintenance schemes.

## Risks and Recommendations

### Main Risks

- Fish death due to filtration failures, overheating, overpopulation, ammonia/nitrite spikes.
- Disease outbreaks (bacteria, fungi, parasites) requiring quick isolation/treatment.
- Microelement balance disruption (Mg, K, Ca, microelement deficiency for fish and algae).
- Automation failure (pumps, lighting, air supply), poor water replacement.
- Silting/swamping of individual zones — scheduled cleaning and rotation.

### Recommendations

- Regular audit and water replacement (10–20% per week), use of "resting" reservoirs.
- Reserve of crop seeds, breeding fish, microalgae strains — minimum for 2–3 years.
- Duplication of critical pumps, aeration and sensors.
- Quick response to disease outbreaks: quarantine, treatment, water change, microalgae "biobuffer" use.
- Maximally simple automation, possibility of "manual" mode and training all participants for emergency work.

## Autonomy and Strategic Reserves

- All main system components (fish, plants, microalgae, bacteria) stored as living/dormant/frozen material (biobank).
- Emergency feed reserves (dry algae, preserved plants, concentrates) ensure 2–3 months survival in emergency mode.
- With minimal culture/strain replenishment every 2–3 years, system can work for decades.

## Conclusion

Integrated aquaponic-algae system ensures sustainable protein, vitamin and feed supply, stabilizes mineral balance, provides biological flexibility and "food security" for crew, minimizing external import and health risks under any weather and operational conditions.
