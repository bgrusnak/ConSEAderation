# Biosystem and Food Production

## Key Elements and Parameters

- **Nutrition standard:** per person — 500 g protein, 500 g vegetables/fruits, 150 g grains/day (+20% reserve).
- **Livestock:** guinea pigs (sea guinea pig, hybrids and pure lines — minimum 8), goats (2 lines × 4 heads), Vietnamese pigs (2 lines × 4 heads), poultry (3 lines), fish (3–4 lines per breed, sturgeon, tilapia, other options) (10–15 m³ water), insects (insectarium).
- **Plants:** hydroponics/aquaponics — up to 300 m² (vegetables, grains, root crops); garden of dwarf/low-growing fruit trees and halophytes (barrier and nutrition).
- **Microalgae:** 1–1.5 m³ photobioreactors, up to 3 tons biomass per year (for feed, supplements, emergency food).
- **Fungi and worms:** substrate from organics and hydroponic remains, protein and biodegradation. Oyster mushrooms, champignons, shiitake ?? TODO: Discuss

## Supported Population and System

- 15 permanent residents, possibility to increase to 30–50 (short-term, with emergency farm mobilization and transition to reserves).
- Multi-level system: plants, fish, animals (guinea pigs, goats, pigs, poultry), insects, algae, fungi and worms.
- All food cycles designed for closed recirculation of water, macro- and microelements.

## Daily and Annual Consumption

| Indicator        | Per 1 person/day | Per 15 people/day | Per 15 people/year |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Protein (g)      | 500              | 7,500             | 2,737,500         |
| Vegetables/fruits (g) | 500         | 7,500             | 2,737,500         |
| Grains (g)       | 150              | 2,250             | 821,250           |
| Water (l, food)  | ~3               | ~45               | ~16,400           |

*+20% food reserve for crop failure, increased load or long-term guest composition.*

## Livestock and Biomass Structure

- **Guinea pigs (sea guinea pigs, meat breed):** hybrid and pure lines, minimum 8 heads, 24-36 offspring — fast turnover, compactness, high protein yield.
- **Goats:** two genetic lines, 4 heads each, 3-4 offspring — source of milk and meat, resistant to conditions, important for amino acid balance.
- **Vietnamese pigs:** two lines of 4 heads each, 6-8 offspring — meat, waste processing, fast herd recovery.
- **Poultry:** quail, chickens, minimum three lines (meat) for each species, 4-6 individuals per line, 10-40 offspring per species.
- **Fish:** 3–4 lines per breed, main volume — sturgeon, tilapia, hybrid or local variants, total 10–15 m³ water.
- **Insects:** insectarium for protein and feed base (mealworm, zophobas, others).
- **Microalgae:** 1–1.5 m³ photobioreactors, annual yield up to 3 tons dry biomass (partly for feed, partly as emergency food and vitamin-mineral supplement).
- **Fungi:** oyster mushrooms, champignons, shiitake (under discussion), grown on organic substrate from hydroponic culture remains and waste.
- **Worms:** vermiculture on organic waste, source of feed, biohumus and accelerated biodegradation.

## Plant System

- Main circuit — hydroponics/aquaponics (up to 300 m²):
    - Leafy vegetables, root crops, legumes, grains, cereal grasses for feed.
    - Barrier garden of dwarf or low-growing fruit trees (lemon, orange, feijoa, fig) and halophytes (edible saltbush, glasswort, purslane).
- All plants selected for maximum nutrient yield and adaptation to closed cycle conditions.

---

## Operating Modes and Autonomy

- Standard autonomy — 2–3 years without spare parts replenishment (seeds, vitamins, preparations, genetic material).
- With rare deliveries — 25+ years maintaining basic composition and productivity.
- All main reserves (dormant seeds, cultures, biomaterial, vitamin concentrates) laid with double reserve.

---

## Technologies and Processes

- Closed cycle of water and macroelements.
- Process automation — sensors, relays, manual emergency mode.
- Composting, biogas, vermiculture, organic processing into biomass/feed.
- Capsule storage of seeds, cultures, biomaterials.
- Regular livestock rotation and culture change according to schedule.
- Manual control system for entire cycle (in case of automation failure).

---

## Labor and Living Organization

- Shift distribution of responsibilities across all directions (animals, plants, aquaponics, maintenance).
- Technical and sanitary facilities for preparation, storage, processing and cooking.
- Workshop for repair and emergency work.

---

## Safety and Emergency Support

- Duplication of key cultures and animal lines.
- Emergency modes: manual control, emergency reserves, backup energy and nutrition.
- Clear instruction for quarantine, culture change, infected block destruction.

---

## Risks and Recommendations

### Main Risks

- Loss of key cultures, livestock death, disease outbreaks.
- Automation failures, irrigation, lighting, filtration failure, spare parts shortage.
- Vitamin, microelement, medicine deficiency, genetic depletion.
- Psychological and physical burnout of personnel during manual control.
- Violation of temperature, water, sanitary regime.

### Recommendations

- Maintain at least two-year reserve of all spare parts (seeds, preparations, feed).
- Duplicate critical lines of cultures and animals (including storage of frozen/dormant samples).
- Introduce regulation for manual startup of all processes for entire crew.
- Use most maintainable technologies and maximally simple solutions.
- Regular rotation and sanitary treatment of zones, disease prevention.
- Psychological crew support, labor and living optimization.

## Conclusion

The system ensures complete nutrition, minimal dependence on external supplies and ability to adapt to any emergency situations even under complete isolation conditions.
